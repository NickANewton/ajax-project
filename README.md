# Anirate

A front-end web application for anime lovers who want to rate and review anime.
## Why Anirate?
Anirate was my first solo prjoject. I wanted to create an app revolving around one of my hobbies, anime, which made the process that much more enjoyable. Anirate is based on the popular anime review site, My Anime List.
